# Hi 👋, I'm Brian!

I am a fullstack software developer with a biased love for backend web development. I'm currently working with REACT and VueJS to create single-page web apps, JAVASCRIPT, RUBY-on-RAILS, Laravel, and MySQL. I strive to make the technology industry more accessible to aspiring developers and engineers by creating and collaborating on projects that aim to solve the daily real human problems. I've learned many lessons along the way that I'll be glad to share with anyone who might be interested.
